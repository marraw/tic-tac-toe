# Tic Tac Toe

This is my **second** project created with Angular CLI (version 11.0.2). A very simple game that let's you play vs a friend sharing one device or against AI.

## Layout

This is my first app in which I'm using SCSS and it really makes things easier. As always, I try to keep it simple and easy to use.

## Progressive Web App

The game is working as PWA. You can add it to your homescreen or even play offline.

## Build

This app is build with Angular Universal as pre-render which improves SEO a lot.
