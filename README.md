# Tic Tac Toe

This is my **second** project created with **Angular CLI** (version 11.0.2). A very simple game that let's you play vs a friend sharing one device or against AI.

## Technologies

In this project I'm using:
- Angular
- Angular Universal (prerender)
- Angular PWA
- TypeScript
- SCSS
- Git

## Setup

To install this project locally clone the repository and use **npm**.

`$ npm install`

To work at **localhost:4200** in watch mode. Add `-o` flag to open automatically in your default browser.

`$ npm serve` 

To build prerender app. The outcome will be located at **/dist/browser** folder.

`$ npm run prerender`

## Server

App is prerendered with **Angular Universal** which improves **SEO** a lot. For a server I'm using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) service.

## Layout

This is my first app in which I'm using **SCSS** and it really makes things easier. As always, I try to keep it simple and easy to use.

## Progressive Web App

Tic Tac Toe has **Progressive Web App** capabilities. You can add it to your homescreen or even play offline thanks to **Service Workers**.
